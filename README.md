# Introduction
 *  This library code implements the driving code of [Aurora(V231) or Spectra EPDs with iTC driver](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/products/epd-product-selection/) made by [Pervasive Displays Inc (PDi)](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/). This is compatible with either [EPD Extension Kit Gen 2 (EXT2)](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/epd-extension-kit-gen-2-ext2/) and [EPD Extension Kit Gen 3 (EXT3)](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/epd-extension-kit-gen-3-ext3/).
 *  It implements the global update mode (GU). However, the same code for fast and partial update are shared upon request. Contact [PDi](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/technical-support/) for further details.
 *  The library supports the following EPD sizes: 1.54", 2.13", 2.66", 2.71", 2.87", 3.70", 4.20", 4.37"
 *  This library was tested with Launchpad (Tiva-C) with TM4C123, MSP432P401R, Arduino M0 Pro, Raspberry Pi Pico, and ESP32DevKitC.


# Installation
  Download the ZIP file of this library and install as instructed in [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries) or Energia.

# Hardware Setup
 *  If using Launchpad (Tiva-C) with TM4C123 or MSP432P401R, the SPI pins are by default:
``` c++
// Using EXT3
    SCK = 7     // BROWN
    BUSY = 11   // RED
    D/C = 12    // ORANGE
    RST = 13    // YELLOW
    MOSI = 15   // BLUE
    ECSM = 19   // GRAY
    
 // Using EXT2
    SCK = 7    
    BUSY = 8  
    D/C = 9
    RST = 10
    MOSI = 15
    ECSM = 19
    PNLON = 11
    BS = 17
 ```
 *  If using Arduino M0 Pro,
  ```
    SCK = 13 
    BUSY = 4  
    D/C = 5
    RST = 6
    MOSI = 12
    ECSM = 8
    PNLON = 11	only for EXT2
    BS = 9	only for EXT2
 ```
  *  If using Raspberry Pi Pico,
  ```
    SCK = 18 
    BUSY = 13  
    D/C = 12
    RST = 11
    MOSI = 19
    ECSM = 17
    PNLON = 8	only for EXT2
    BS = 7	only for EXT2
 ```
 
   *  If using ESP32DevKitC,
  ```
    SCK = 18 
    BUSY = 27  
    D/C = 26
    RST = 25
    MOSI = 23
    ECSM = 32
    PNLON = 16	only for EXT2
    BS = 17	only for EXT2
 ```

# EPD_Driver Demo
 *  The sample code implements a global update functionality for a [2.71" Spectra R2.0 EPD (CE2271JS094)](https://www.pervasivedisplays.com/product/2-71-e-ink-display-spectra-r2-0/).  
 
 First, a BW(black and white) image is flashed.  
  <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/EPD_Driver_GU_small/blob/main/examples/Demo_271/globalupdate_src/images/2.71/271_264x176_BW.bmp"></p>
 After a second, a BWR (black, white, red) image follows.  
 <p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/PervasiveDisplays/EPD_Driver_GU_small/blob/main/examples/Demo_271/globalupdate_src/images/2.71/271_264x176_BWR.bmp"></p>
 
 *  The demo currently includes sample images for all the supported EPD sizes mentioned above. To implement global update demo on these other sizes, update the following lines
``` c++
//------------------------------------------------------------
// DEMO Image Set <Comment out when in User Mode>
// Screen Size: 154, 213, 266, 271, 287, 370, 420, 437
#define SCREEN 271
#include "globalupdate_src/demoImageData.h"
// User Mode Image Set
//#include "globalupdate_src/userImageData.h"
```
 *  Then select the appropriate EPD size, development board and extension kit:
```
  // EPD_Driver epdtest(eScreen_EPD_271, boardLaunchPad_EXT3);
  // EPD_Driver epdtest(eScreen_EPD_271, boardArduinoM0Pro_EXT2);
  EPD_Driver epdtest(eScreen_EPD_271, boardRaspberryPiPico_RP2040_EXT3);
  // EPD_Driver epdtest(eScreen_EPD_271, boardRaspberryPiPico_RP2040_EXT2);
```
